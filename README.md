# Risk-Assessment-Calculator
This was my project for vocational training during 5th semester. This helps organisations to calculate cyber risk based on various factors.
The OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator is a web-based application designed to evaluate security risks based on the OWASP Risk RatingMethodology. This tool enables users to systematically assess potentialsecurity threats by analyzing threat agent factors, vulnerability factors,technical impact, and business impact. By selecting various parameters,users can calculate likelihood, impact, and overall risk severity scores, which are visually represented using interactive charts. The calculator simplifies risk assessment by providing an easy-to-useinterface for security professionals, developers, and organizations toestimate and prioritize vulnerabilities efficiently. The tool's structured approach helps in identifying high-risk areas and supports informeddecision-making for mitigating security threats. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the application ensures responsiveness and accessibility while integrating Chart.js for data visualization. By leveraging OWASPâ€™s standardizedmethodology, this project contributes to enhanced cybersecurity practices and risk management strategies across various domains.
